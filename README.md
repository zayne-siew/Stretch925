**Stretch925** is an application that rewards fatigued corporate workers for taking their much-needed breaks and promotes a healthy stretching habit through gamification. It is available both on web and mobile.
All users must perform a one-time Singpass login to sign up for Stretch925.

## Features

### Gamification and Rewards
During the stretching break, Stretch925 first selects a random set of 3 stretches in a roulette manner and awards points to the user based on the number of stretch repetitions performed by the user.
The user can use these points to redeem from a catalogue of rewards available.

### Accurate Detection of Stretch Repetitions
Stretch925 leverages on [PeekingDuck](https://github.com/aisingapore/PeekingDuck) to obtain pose estimations 
and counts the number of stretch repetitions performed by the user.
Some of these stretches currently supported are:

- **Y-W Stretch** - 
- **Neck Stretch** - 
- **Side Stretch** -
